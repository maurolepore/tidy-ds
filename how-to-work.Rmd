1. Initialize a pull request with `usethis::pr_init("file-name_your-name")`.

2. Copy this file as `file-name_your-name.Rmd`.

3. Submit a draft pull request with `usethis::pr_push()`.

4. For each task, expand and work in one of the three chunks:
  * `some-label-1`: This is the hardest. It has no code; you need to type everything from scratch.
  * `some-label-2`: This is the easiest. It has degraded code as hints; you need to fill the blanks and remove the chunk option `eval` or set it to `TRUE`.
  * `some-label-3`: This is already done. Use it when you are stuck and to check your results. Once your own code works, you may remove this chunk to avoid duplication.

5. After completing each task, commit with a meaningful message and update your pull request with `usethis::pr_sync()`.
