For each task, expand and work in one of the three chunks:

* `some-label-1`: This is the hardest -- it has no code so you need to code everything from scratch.

* `some-label-2`: This is intermediate -- it has hints in the form of degraded code. You need to fill the blanks and remove the chunk option `eval` or set it to `TRUE`.

* `some-label-3`: I no brainer -- it's already complete and you can use it to check your results. If your version works, you may remove it do avoid duplication.
