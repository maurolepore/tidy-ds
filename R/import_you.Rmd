* In `setup` chunk, set your favorite options.

```{r setup-1, include=FALSE}

```

```{r setup-2, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = ____, comment = "__")
```

```{r setup-3, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

* Use the tidyverse, here, fs, and vroom.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(fs)
library(vroom)
```

* Find all files in "data/by-continent/" with `dir_ls(here("some", "thing"))`.

```{r}
paths <- dir_ls(here("data", "by-continent"))

paths
```

* Import all files into a single data frame with `vroom()`. 

* Compare `vroom()` with `read_csv()` and `read.csv()`.

* Explore the data interactively with `View()`.

```{r}
vroom(paths)
```

* Knit and discuss the output. What is interesting or unclear?
