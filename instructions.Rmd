For each task, expand and work in one of the three chunks:

* `some-label-1`: This is the hardest. It has no code; you need to type everything from scratch.

* `some-label-2`: This is the easiest. It has degraded code as hints; you need to fill the blanks and remove the chunk option `eval` or set it to `TRUE`.

* `some-label-3`: This is already done. Use it when you are stuck and to check your results. Once your own code works, you may remove this chunk to avoid duplication.
